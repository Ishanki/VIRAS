# VIRAS: Viral Infection Risk Assessment Simulation

Estimation of viral contamination in a confined space and risk of infection for individuals.
The model simulates the transmission of a respiratory virus through the fomite, close contact (large respiratory droplets) and aerosol pathways. Discrete events such as cleaning, individuals entering and leaving a confined space, and touch events are also considered. <br/>

The model can be run on Matlab using InfectionRisk_main.m, and on Python using InfectionRisk_main.py. <br/> 
Ensure a file containing all the required inputs in the required format, labelled "Inputs.xlsx", is avialable when when running the models; see example "Inputs.xlsx" file provided under Matlab and Python folders. <br/>

N.B. This is a working repository. More detailed instructions and requirements.txt to support the use of these models will be added in the near future.
